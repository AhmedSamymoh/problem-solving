Some of the military spies managed to break into the creature's warehouse, each spy is provided with a shockwave rifle. After they broke in, the spies found that the creatures have different heights and guard the warehouse in queues. You need to know what each creature can see to be able to defeat them.N creatures are standing in a queue to guard the warehouse, numbered from 0 to N - 1 in left to right order. You have the height of each creature as an input. Each creature can see the other creature to its right in that queue if every creature in between is shorter than both. For more explanation, see the example below.Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer q  q: the number of test cases (1 ≤ q ≤30) The following q inputs, each contains integer N then array of size N which contains each creature height ordered from left to right.  N equals the number of creatures in a queue. [1 ≤ N ≤ 105 ]  No more than one creature can have the same height. [1 ≤ height ≤ 105 ]  Output Array of size N for each test case where Array[i] is the number of creatures ith creature can see to their right.  Required  Take q as user input.  Take number of creatures in each array then take array containing creatures’ heights as user input.  Find number of creatures each creature can see.  Output array of the answer for each test case
